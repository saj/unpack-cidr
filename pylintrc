[MESSAGES CONTROL]

# duplicate-code:
#   False positives galore.  Human code review is more effective at
#   highlighting opportunities for refactoring.
#
# fixme:
#   Suppress warnings for TODOs in comments.  TODOs, when used properly,
#   should never be used to flag broken code, so these should be safe to
#   ignore in automated linter checks.
#
# locally-disabled,
# locally-enabled:
#   Nuisance informational 'warnings' that highlight pylint pragmas in
#   code.  We insert these pragmas specifically to avoid pylint feedback
#   in cases where deviation from policy is warranted.
#
# too-few-public-methods:
#   This feedback is counter-productive at best, and completely wrong at
#   worst.  It is reasonable, for example, to break up a large and
#   complex function into a private helper class with only a constructor
#   and single public method as its interface.  Within such classes,
#   smaller (protected) methods and fewer function arguments make for
#   more readable code.  In other cases, this message is incorrectly
#   reported for subclasses that exist only to override Python data
#   model methods (like __add__(), __cmp__(), and so on).
#
#   Upstream pylint will be deprecating and removing too-few-* for these
#   reasons:
